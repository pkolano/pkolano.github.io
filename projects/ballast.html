    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Ballast is a framework that was specifically designed for
        SSH load balancing by taking advantage of the aliasing and
        proxying capabilities available in most SSH clients.  Within a
        traditional SSH bastion architecture, where internal resources
        can only be accessed from the outside via a hardened bastion
        system, Ballast is completely transparent to users and does not
        require any external modifications.  Bastions and internal hosts
        must have the Ballast client and a pipe-based TCP relay utility
        such as netcat installed, which can be easily managed across
        internal hosts by configuration management tools.</p>

        <p>Ballast consists of a Ballast agent on each balanced host,
        a Ballast server on one or more data servers, and a Ballast
        client on each bastion and internal host from which the user
        might access balanced hosts.  The Ballast agent periodically
        collects system load information and sends it to the Ballast
        server.  The server aggregates the load data received from all
        agents and stores it in a suitable form for making balancing
        decisions.  When the user invokes SSH to a host alias designated
        for balancing, SSH triggers the Ballast client, which contacts
        the server to resolve balancing aliases to actual balanced host
        names.  The server consults its data and returns one or more
        hosts, one of which the client connects to via netcat (or
        equivalent), after which the login proceeds normally.</p>

        <p>Unlike traditional load balancers, Ballast has the ability to
        adjust its balancing strategy based on the invoking user.  By
        tailoring system selections specifically to each individual
        user, the utility to each user can be maximized instead of
        choosing a system that may be best according to a common metric,
        but not ideal for the user's needs.</p>

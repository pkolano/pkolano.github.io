    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Dyper is a framework for dynamic perimeter enforcement
        based on the notion of a pinhole, which is a dynamic rule that
        allows TCP/UDP traffic to pass from a specific external host to
        a specific port on a specific internal host.  The basic approach
        is to open a pinhole exactly when the external host needs to
        establish an inbound auxiliary connection and to close that
        pinhole exactly when the external host no longer needs the
        connection.  By using this approach, sites with least privilege
        policies can still communicate, but users cannot hijack pinholes
        for their own purposes because the internal host will already be
        using the associated ports.</p>

        <p>A single pinhole corresponds to a TCP/UDP ACL on a
        perimeter enforcer, which is defined by the 5-tuple of protocol,
        source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and
        destination port.  Since pinholes only require basic ACLs, which
        can be done at line-rate on many network devices, the pinhole
        approach supports performance at the maximum capacity of the
        network itself.  To successfully implement a pinhole approach,
        however, it is necessary to accurately determine three key
        pieces of information: which internal ports will be used for
        auxiliary connections, when these connections are needed, and
        which external host will initiate them.  This information is
        gathered by an interposition agent that intercepts system calls
        running within internal clients and servers.</p>

        <p>Once all of the required information has been observed by the
        interposition agent and a pinhole request has been generated,
        that request must be carried out on the perimeter enforcer.
        The perimeter controller is defined to be the system that
        interacts with the perimeter enforcer to dynamically open and
        close pinholes upon request.  Since network services will be
        hosted and invoked on potentially many different systems,
        pinhole requests generated by an interposition agent must be
        authenticated and sent to the perimeter controller host.  After
        a request reaches the perimeter controller, it is authorized
        against a set of allowed perimeter changes.  Finally, the
        request is executed by making the appropriate ACL changes on the
        perimeter enforcer.</p>

    <h2><a href="astral.html">ASTRAL</a></h2>
        <p>ASTRAL is a formal specification language for real-time
        systems.  The structuring mechanisms in ASTRAL allow one to
        build modularized specifications of complex systems with
        layering.  A real-time system is modeled by a collection of
        state machine specifications and a single global specification.
        The ASTRAL Software Development Environment (SDE) is an
        integrated set of design and analysis tools based on the ASTRAL
        formal framework. The tools that make up the SDE are a
        syntax-directed editor, a specification processor, a
        verification condition generator, a browser kit, a model
        checker, and a mechanical theorem prover.</p>

    <h2><a href="ballast.html">Ballast</a></h2>
        <p>Ballast is a tool for balancing user load across SSH
        servers based on configurable criteria such as CPU load and
        system availability.  Ballast is invoked as part of the SSH
        login process, hence has access to the user name, which is not
        available in traditional load balancers.  This gives ballast the
        unique ability to perform user-specific load balancing, which
        has several benefits including separating users who have
        historically generated high loads and providing a common login
        interface to users who may be separated based on other criteria
        such as system accessibility.  Ballast includes a simple client,
        a lightweight data server, and a data collection agent.</p>

    <h2><a href="dyper.html">Dyper</a></h2>
        <p>Dyper is a framework for enabling least privilege network
        security policies based on dynamic perimeter control.  Dyper
        observes the behavior of network services to identify the
        specific inbound perimeter access that is required at any given
        time and dynamically adjusts the ACLs of a perimeter enforcer to
        open and close the perimeter accordingly.  It supports inbound
        access for both clients and servers and is completely
        transparent to external users.  Internal services must be
        invoked slightly differently, but no source code modifications
        nor changes to user usage patterns are required.  Through the
        use of the Dyper framework, each site can have the tightest
        perimeter policy possible and yet still communicate at the
        highest bandwidth with almost any multiport application.</p>

    <h2><a href="mesh.html">Mesh</a></h2>
        <p>Mesh is a secure, lightweight grid middleware that is based
        on the addition of a single sign-on capability to the built-in
        public key authentication mechanism of SSH using system call
        interposition.  Resources may be added to a Mesh-based grid in a
        matter of minutes using just five small files and two
        environment variable settings.  Mesh adheres to fundamental
        security principles and was designed to be compatible with
        strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication,
        SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls.  Mesh uses a remote
        command model, which is based on stock SSH clients and the
        syntax and commands already understood by users, thus requires
        no additional software or knowledge to utilize effectively.
        Several existing services have been integrated with Mesh to
        provide resource discovery and query, high performance file
        transfer, and job management.</p>

    <h2><a href="mutil.html">Mutil</a></h2>
        <p>Mutil is a set of standard utilities that employ multiple
        types of parallelism and other optimizations to achieve maximum
        performance on modern file systems.  Multi-threading is used to
        ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible.  Double
        buffering allows individual operations within a single task to
        be overlapped using asynchronous I/O.  Multi-node cooperation
        allows different nodes to take part in the same task.  Split
        file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently
        on the same file.  Finally, additional optimizations such as
        buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can
        reduce performance.  Mutil currently includes drop-in
        replacements for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have
        achieved 10/30x rates on one/many nodes.</p> 

    <h2><a href="naturalization.html">Naturalization Service</a></h2>
        <p>The Naturalization Service is a service for automatically
        naturalizing user applications to grid resources.  The functions
        of this service include (1) automatically identifying the
        dependencies of user applications with support for executables,
        shared libraries, Java classes, and Perl and Python programs,
        (2) establishing a suitable environment by transferring
        dependent software and setting key environment variables
        necessary for each application to run, and (3) managing a
        flexible software catalog, which is used to locate software
        dependencies based on both centrally managed and user controlled
        mappings.</p>

    <h2><a href="pieman.html">Pieman</a></h2>
        <p>Pieman is a command-line tool for managing personal
        information such as appointments, contacts, and tasks as well
        as other data such as notes and rc files. It is a portable
        pure-perl tool inspired by abook, devtodo, mutt, and pal,
        among others.</p>

    <h2><a href="pour.html">Pour</a></h2>
        <p>Pour is a general-purpose information service framework
        designed to accommodate a wide variety of information types
        with support for high volume, low frequency periodic updates,
        user-specified updates, and automatic updates collected
        on-demand when needed.  Information is stored exclusively in XML
        and retrieved using standard XPath queries over a single unified
        namespace independent of the information's source.</p>

    <h2><a href="retools.html">Retools</a></h2>
        <p>Retools is a set of modifications to the commonly used open
        source utilities bzip2, gzip, rsync, and tar that automatically
        selects the Lustre stripe count for created and/or extracted
        files according to the sizes of the files involved.  By striping
        large files over a higher number of physical disks and small
        files over a lower number, aggregate I/O bandwidth for large
        files is maximized and the impact to the file system due to
        small files is minimized.</p>

    <h2><a href="save.html">Save</a></h2>
        <p>Save is a lightweight framework for creating high
        availability systems.  Save manages IP addresses shared
        between multiple servers with the same function and monitors the
        health of those servers to determine which should be actively
        servicing requests at any given time.  Save has additional
        features to facilitate the administration of high availability
        systems.  Synchronization mechanisms allow configuration files
        to be kept consistent between systems as well as allowing
        commands to be executed across all servers of a particular type.
        Archival mechanisms provide automatic version control of
        configuration files to aid in recovery in case of errant
        configuration.  Validation mechanisms allow configuration files
        to be automatically checked for correctness before they are
        installed on all peer servers.</p>

    <h2><a href="savors.html">Savors</a></h2>
        <p>Savors is a visualization framework that supports the
        ingestion of data streams created by arbitrary command
        pipelines.  Any number of data streams can be shown synchronized
        by time in the same or different views, which can be arranged in
        any layout.  These capabilities combined with a powerful
        parallelization mechanism and interaction models already
        familiar to administrators allows Savors to display complex
        visualizations of data streamed from many different systems with
        minimal effort.</p>
 
    <h2><a href="screenwm.html">Screenwm</a></h2>
        <p>Screenwm is a window management extension to GNU Screen
        that adds (1) multiple region layouts within a single session,
        (2) vi-like movement within complex layouts, (3) window
        associations by region, and (4) control of remote/embedded
        sessions using standard key bindings.</p>

    <h2><a href="shift.html">Shift</a></h2>
        <p>Shift is a lightweight framework for high performance local
        and remote file transfers that provides resiliency across a wide
        variety of failure scenarios through various techniques.  These
        include end-to-end integrity via cryptographic hashes,
        throttling of transfers to prevent resource exhaustion,
        balancing transfers across resources based on load and
        availability, and parallelization of transfers across multiple
        source and destination hosts for increased redundancy and
        performance.</p>

    <h2><a href="skip.html">Skip</a></h2>
        <p>Skip is a lightweight and portable tool for managing
        secrets such as login passwords and easily automating the
        programs that use them without leaving the secrets unencrypted
        on disk.  Skip has been tested successfully with several common
        programs including fetchmail, getmail, msmtp, scp, ssh, and
        ssh-add without the need for any modification on Linux, OSX, and
        Windows under Cygwin.</p>

    <h2><a href="surfer.html">Surfer</a></h2>
        <p>Surfer is a general-purpose framework for selecting and
        ranking grid resources based on user constraints and
        preferences.  Surfer has no built-in bias towards any job model
        or selection policy, thus is suitable for inclusion in any grid
        environment by adding information providers knowledgeable about
        that environment.  Information is pulled from these providers as
        needed allowing Surfer to efficiently handle large and complex
        information sources unsuitable for push-based models.</p>

    <h2><a href="swim.html">Swim</a></h2>
        <p>Swim is a software information service for the grid built
        on top of Pour.  Swim provides true software resource discovery
        integrated with the tools used by administrators to install
        software.  In particular, software information is periodically
        gathered from native package managers on FreeBSD, Solaris, and
        IRIX as well as the RPM, Perl, and Python package managers on
        multiple platforms.  Swim has additional facilities for
        collecting on-demand information about arbitrary software on any
        grid-enabled resource including software dependencies and Unix
        "stat" information.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Save is a framework for implementing highly available
        network-accessible services.  Save sends and monitors SSH-based
        heartbeats so that passive servers can detect if the active
        server is still available.  A common sevice IPv4 and/or IPv6
        address can be given and taken using gratuitous ARP (IPv4)
        and/or unsolicited neighbor advertisement (IPv6).</p>

        <p>In addition to heartbeat/failover functionality, the Save
        command-line tool has a number of features.  This tool provides
        an interface to control IP failover.  In particular, the
        administrator can force the active node to yield the failover IP
        address, force the backup node to take over the failover IP
        address, or label a node as down so that it will not attempt to
        take over the failover IP address under any condition.</p>

        <p>The command-line tool also controls the validation, archival,
        and synchronization features of Save.  Validation is used to
        make sure that a configuration file conforms to some specified
        characteristics such as format before it is installed on other
        nodes.  Archival is used to save a copy of the previous
        configuration if, for some reason, the new configuration results
        in errant behavior.  Finally, synchronization features can be
        used to keep files consistent between the active and passive
        node(s) and/or to execute the same command across all nodes at
        once.</p>

        <p>The configuration of the Save command-line tool determines
        what actions will be taken at which times.  The administrator
        need only prepend the "save" command (i.e. the name of the tool)
        to any command and the appropriate actions will be taken if they
        are applicable.  In this way, administrators can simply perform
        their normal tasks, such as editing files (e.g. "save vi
        /etc/config/ file"), and Save will take care of checking
        validity, backing up old versions, and synchronizing files
        across systems if required.  For files for which there are no
        specific actions defined within the Save configuration, the
        "save" command has no effect, which allows the administrator to
        safely prepend this to any command.</p>

        <p>Save is in active production at the NASA Advanced
        Supercomputing Facility and has been ensuring the high
        availability of the <a href=

        Secure Unattended Proxy</a> system since Sept. 2007.</p>

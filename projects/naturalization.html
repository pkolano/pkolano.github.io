    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Naturalization is defined as the process of "adapting or
        acclimating (a plant or animal) to a new environment;
        introducing and establishing as if native".  The Naturalization
        Service is a service for automatically naturalizing user
        applications to grid resources.  The execution environment for
        an application on a given resource consists of the software
        existing on that resource and the settings of the environment
        variables when the application runs.  For each execution
        operation in a given job, the function of the Naturalization
        Service is to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Determine the software that the execution operation
            application requires</li>

            <li>Provide a location for that software on the execution
        operation host by:
            <ul>
                <li>Determining if the software exists on the
                execution operation host</li>

                <li>Finding a source for any missing software</li>

                <li>Copying missing software to the execution operation
                host</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Set environment variables based on provided software
            locations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A list of dependencies is associated with each execution
        operation.  A dependency consists of basic requirements
        including a type, a name, a version range, and a feature list as
        well as information gathered during processing including a
        source host and path, a target path, and an "analyzed flag" to
        indicate its analysis status.  The Naturalization Service
        currently supports five software types: executables, shared
        libraries, Java classes, and Perl and Python programs.  The
        dependency name holds the canonical name for the software
        depending on its type (e.g. ls, libc, java.util.List,
        File::Basename, xml.sax.xmlreader, etc.).  The version range
        consists of a minimum and/or maximum version required.  The
        feature list contains features that the dependency must support.
        For example, the application might require the w3m browser
        compiled with SSL support.</p>

        <p>The source host and path, target path, and analyzed flag
        are used to store information as processing proceeds.  Stages
        are only executed if the information they provide has not
        already been gathered.  Thus, a job for which the execution
        environment has already been fully established can be sent
        through the Naturalization Service without effect.  This allows
        the user to have complete control of job processing.  A user can
        execute stages individually, can specify dependencies manually,
        can turn analysis off, can specify an exact source for software,
        can specify a location where software already exists, or any
        combination thereof.  The Naturalization Service will fill in
        any gaps in the environment left by the user or return the job
        unchanged if no modifications are necessary.</p>

            This project never made it past the prototype stage, but

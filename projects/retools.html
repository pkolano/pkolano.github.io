    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Standard open source tools for file transfer, archival, and
        compression do not typically take Lustre striping
        characteristics into account.  Since striping cannot be changed
        after a file is created, the files resulting from such
        operations are often stuck with default striping, which can be
        suboptimal for later access to those files.  A large default
        stripe count can cause operations on small files to impact the
        performance of the file system as a whole due to excess disk
        activity.  A small default stripe count penalizes large files,
        which will only be able to achieve a fraction of the performance
        possible due to I/O bottlenecks.</p>

        <p>Retools is a set of modifications to the commonly used open
        source utilities bzip2, gzip, rsync, and tar that automatically
        selects the Lustre stripe count for created and/or extracted
        files according to the sizes of the files involved.  By striping
        large files over a higher number of physical disks and small
        files over a lower number, aggregate I/O bandwidth for large
        files is maximized and the impact to the file system due to
        small files is minimized.  These tools support the typical
        workflow in high performance computing environments where users
        compress large files and/or aggregate multiple small files
        into a single archive during remote transfers.  Once
        uncompressed/unarchived into their original form, these files
        will be optimally striped for subsequent operations.</p>

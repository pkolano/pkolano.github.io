    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Swim is a Software Information Metacatalog that gathers
        detailed information about the software components and packages
        installed on each grid resource.  Information is currently
        gathered for Executable and Linking Format (ELF) executables and
        shared libraries, Java classes, shell scripts, and Perl and
        Python modules.  Swim is built on top of the Pour framework,
        which is a general-purpose framework for reconciling information
        from periodic, on-demand, and user-specified sources.  Swim
        consists of a set of Perl modules for extracting software
        information from a system, an XML schema defining the format of
        data that can be added by users, and a Pour XML configuration
        file that describes how these elements are utilized to generate
        periodic, on-demand, and user-specified information.  The Pour
        framework provides the user interface and the basic back-end
        information storage and retrieval.  Pour validates
        user-specified information against the Swim XML schema and calls
        the appropriate Swim modules when information is required
        on-demand.  Periodic information is generated by cron jobs that
        run Swim scripts on each grid resource and invoke the
        appropriate Pour method to add the information to a Pour
        repository on some host.</p>

        <p>Periodic software information is derived mainly from the
        package managers used on each system.  Swim collects information
        from native package managers on FreeBSD, Solaris, and IRIX, as
        well as the RPM, Perl, and Python package managers on multiple
        platforms.  It is advantageous to use package managers since in
        most cases they are the tools used by administrators to install
        the software in the first place.  Since not all software is
        available or installed in package form, however, Swim also
        crawls the set of relevant paths from the Filesystem Hierarchy
        Standard, which defines the standard filesystem structure used
        by all major Unix distributions.  Using these two techniques,
        the vast majority of software installed on a system will be
        located.</p>

        <p>Information that is too expensive to compute for all
        software components or that is specific to individual users can
        be computed on-demand based on the query arguments.  Swim
        currently supports three types of on-demand information.  It
        derives software dependencies for ELF executables and libraries,
        Java classes, and Perl and Python modules.  It computes the same
        information gathered by the periodic routines for specific files
        on specific hosts.  Finally, it locates software on a system
        given only its name and type.</p>

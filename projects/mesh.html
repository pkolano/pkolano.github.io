    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Mesh is a secure, lightweight grid middleware that is based
        on the addition of a single sign-on capability to the built-in
        public key authentication mechanism of SSH using system call
        interposition.  Each Mesh installation is dedicated to serving a
        particular virtual organization (VO), which is defined to be a
        dynamic collection of individuals, institutions, and resources.
        Mesh allows individuals in one VO to execute SSH remote commands
        on Mesh-accessible resources within other cooperating VOs using
        a single Mesh SSH private key generated at the local VO.  A full
        Mesh deployment consists of two dedicated hosts and three
        primary software components (besides SSH itself).  The first
        host, called the Mesh Proxy (MP), is responsible for mediating
        all SSH remote commands that are to execute on Mesh-accessible
        resources within the VO.  Users that attempt to bypass the MP
        and contact VO resources directly will be unable to utilize Mesh
        authentication, thus ensuring complete mediation.</p>

        </p>Command mediation on the MP is carried out by a software
        component called the Mesh Authorization Shell (Mash).  Mash is a
        highly flexible and customizable login shell replacement that
        parses remote commands and authorizes them against a site
        security policy.  As part of the authorization process, commands
        can optionally be rewritten to force compliance with specific
        site policies or to provide enhanced usability.  Authorized
        commands are passed on to the appropriate VO resource for
        execution using a second SSH remote command.</p>

        </p>VO resources are made Mesh-accessible by injecting a
        software component called the Mesh Interposition Agent (MIA)
        into the resource's SSH server using library preloading, which
        dynamically modifies its behavior during public key
        authentication.  Instead of authenticating against the
        authorized_keys file stored locally in the user's home
        directory, the MIA causes the server to authenticate against an
        authorized_keys file retrieved at run-time from a second
        dedicated host within each VO called the Mesh Authentication
        Point (MAP).</p>

        </p>Single sign-on is achieved during key retrieval from the MAP
        and authentication to the MP.  In Mesh, each individual is
        assumed to have a home VO, which is the VO with which they are
        most frequently associated (e.g. the institution for which they
        work).  When a key is retrieved by the MIA from a MAP that is
        not the user's home MAP, the key retrieval is propagated to the
        home MAP.  Likewise, when authenticating to an MP that is not
        the user's home MP, that MP will initiate a key retrieval from
        the home MP.  Thus, a Mesh key generated at the home VO is valid
        at all VOs.</p>
        
        </p>Once the user has authenticated successfully on the
        Mesh-accessible resource, the MIA ignores the user's login shell
        and instead executes the remote command issued by the MP using a
        software component called the Mesh Exec Security Shell (Mess).
        Mess is a constrained execution shell that ignores
        metacharacters and only executes programs authorized by the
        administrator and not disallowed by the user.  While the command
        is executing, it is subject to read, write, and execution
        controls enforced by the MIA.  Once the command terminates, the
        SSH sessions will terminate as the final step.</p>

        </p>The authentication and authorization components of Mesh
        may be deployed independently, thus allowing VOs to choose
        between a full deployment, a deployment of only the single
        sign-on features without proxying or additional authorizations,
        or a deployment of only authorization components without single
        sign-on.  Although originally intended for grid-like operations,
        organizations without an interest in grid computing can still
        deploy some or all of Mesh to take advantage of the additional
        security features it adds to stock SSH installations.</p>

        <p>Mesh is in active production at the NASA Advanced
        Supercomputing Facility (<a href=

        >https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/entry/145</a>)
        and has handled over 112M remote commands (as of May 2018) since
        stats started being collected in March 2009.</p>

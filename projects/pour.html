    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Pour is a framework for Periodic, On-Demand, and
        User-Specified Information Reconciliation that accepts periodic
        information updates, collects information on-demand as needed,
        and accepts user-specified information while presenting a single
        unified view to the user. The primary functionality of Pour is
        exposed to the user through its query interface.  A query
        consists of any number of XPaths, where each XPath returns a
        list of the XML strings that satisfy it.  Depending on the
        XPaths specified and the contents of the Pour database, query
        processing may be as simple as a database lookup or as complex
        as a series of queries down a Pour hierarchy to a set of Pour
        repositories that compute the requested information on-the-fly
        before the appropriate results are returned.  This complexity is
        invisible to users, who may utilize any valid XPath to retrieve
        results integrated from across the relevant periodic, on-demand,
        and user-specified sources.</p>

        <p>New types of information and the methods used to collect
        them are described by "spouts".  Collection methods are
        described by "pumps" and "drains".  A pump represents pull-based
        information that is actively collected from external sources by
        Pour itself.  A drain represents push-based information that is
        produced elsewhere before flowing into the system.  Pour
        supports two drain types: periodic drains and user drains.
        Periodic drains support information that comes from a trusted
        source at an unknown frequency such that any previous
        information from the same source can be completely overwritten.
        Three periodic update mechanisms are available based on
        subscriptions to grid service data obtained by other services,
        keyed hashes usable by cron jobs, and embedded Java objects,
        which may be used to produce arbitrary information locally.
        User drains support information added by users, which must
        conform to a given XML schema.</p>

        <p>On-demand processing, which can be disabled on a per query
        basis if desired, is triggered according to the pumps defined in
        each spout.  A pump defines a set of XPath prefixes for which it
        has information and a set of XPath restrictions that the query
        XPath must satisfy.  These restrictions can include specific
        attributes or elements that must be defined and/or specific
        values they must take.  Pour currently provides two types of
        built-in pumps.  The Pour pump supports hierarchical caching,
        which is one form of on-demand information.  When invoked, this
        pump passes the query on to a lower level Pour instance for
        processing.  The GRAM pump supports collection using the Globus
        Toolkit GRAM component.  A specified executable is run on a grid
        host with a set of arguments derived from the query arguments.
        The output of this job is then collected by Pour, filtered
        appropriately, and returned to the user.</p>

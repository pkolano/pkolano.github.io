    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>ASTRAL is a formal specification language for real-time
        systems in which a system is described as a collection of state
        machine specifications, where each specification represents a
        process type of which there may be multiple statically generated
        instances. Each process instance in the system executes
        concurrently and asynchronously with all the other process
        instances.  Additionally, a global specification contains
        declarations for types and constants that are shared among more
        than one process type, as well as assumptions about the global
        environment and critical requirements for the whole system.</p>

        <p>An ASTRAL process specification consists of a sequence of
        levels. Each level is an abstract data type view of the system
        being specified. The first ("top level") view is a very abstract
        model of what constitutes the process (types, constants,
        variables), what the process does (state transitions), and the
        critical requirements the process must meet (invariants and
        schedules). Lower levels are increasingly more detailed with
        the lowest level corresponding closely to high level code.</p>

        <p>The process being specified is thought of as being in various
        states, with one state differentiated from another by the values
        of its state variables, which can be changed only by means of
        state transitions. Transitions are described in terms of entry
        and exit assertions by using an extension of first-order
        predicate calculus.  Transition entry assertions describe the
        constraints that state variables must satisfy in order for the
        transition to fire, while exit assertions describe the
        constraints that are fulfilled by state variables after the
        transition has fired. An explicit non-null duration is
        associated with each transition. Transitions are executed as
        soon as they are enabled (i.e. when their entry assertions are
        satisfied) assuming no other transition for that process
        instance is executing.</p>

        <p>Every process can export both state variables and
        transitions; as a consequence, the former are readable by other
        processes while the latter are executable from the external
        environment. Processes communicate by broadcasting the values of
        exported variables and the start and end times of exported
        transitions.</p>

        <p>In addition to specifying system state (through process
        variables and constants) and system evolution (through
        transitions), an ASTRAL specification also defines system
        critical requirements and assumptions on the behavior of the
        environment that interacts with the system. The behavior of the
        environment is expressed by means of environment clauses, which
        describe assumptions about the pattern of invocation of external
        transitions. Critical requirements are expressed by means of
        invariants and schedules. Invariants represent requirements that
        must hold in every state reachable from the initial state, no
        matter what the behavior of the external environment is, while
        schedules represent additional properties that must be satisfied
        provided that the external environment behaves as assumed.</p>

        <p>The computational model for ASTRAL is based on
        nondeterministic state machines and assumes maximal
        parallelism, noninterruptable and nonoverlapping transitions
        in a single process instance, and implicit one-to-many
        (multi-cast) message passing communication.</p>

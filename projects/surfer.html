    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Surfer is an extensible framework designed to select and
        rank grid resources where a resource is defined to be anything
        that may need selecting such as compute resources, storage
        resources, data resources, etc.  The user specifies the set of
        resource types desired, the constraints that must hold over all
        the resources, and the ranking function to be used to order the
        resources.  For each request received, Surfer returns a set of
        resource tuples where each tuple contains a resource instance
        for each resource type requested, each tuple satisfies the
        specified constraints, and tuples are ordered by descending
        values of the given ranking function.</p>

        <p>Constraints and ranking functions are boolean and numeric
        expressions, respectively, utilizing a set of built-in
        arithmetic, boolean, and relational operators, and a set of
        functions supplied by information providers.  Information
        providers are implemented independent of the framework and
        integrated into the system using a single configuration line.
        Providers supply functions of arbitrary type that represent
        selected information such as the number of cpus of a compute
        resource, free disk space of a storage resource, etc.  Providers
        also supply queries used to generate resource sets that define
        the set of resources selectable.  Information providers are
        invisible to the end user, who only sees the set of resource
        types selectable and the set of functions available.  The
        framework worries about which provider is responsible for which
        function, whether to use queries or function calls, how results
        are correlated, etc.</p>

        <p>Requests are processed in four stages.  First, the
        composite constraint is rewritten to a set expression utilizing
        the function calls and queries supplied by providers.  Next, the
        set expression is evaluated to produce the set of resource
        tuples meeting the constraints.  Third, the resource tuples are
        ranked by the composite ranking function.  Finally, the
        requested number of the highest ranked tuples are returned to
        the user.  Once the user receives the resulting tuple set, they
        can then extract the identifying attributes (e.g. host name,
        queue type, and queue name for a compute resource) of each
        resource returned so that they can then utilize those resources
        using other services.</p>

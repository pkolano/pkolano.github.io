    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Large installations involve huge numbers of interacting
        components that are subject to a multitude of hardware failures,
        transient errors, software bugs, and misconfiguration.
        Monitoring the health, utilization, security, and/or
        configuration of such installations is a challenging task.
        While various frameworks are available to assist with these
        tasks at a high level, administrators must more often than not
        revert to using command line tools on individual systems to get
        a low-level understanding of system behavior.  The output from
        such tools can be overwhelming on even a single system, so when
        taken across a large number of hosts, can become intractable.</p>

        <p>Savors is a visualization framework designed to supercharge
        the command-line tools already used by administrators with
        powerful visualizations that help them understand the output
        much more rapidly and with far greater scalability across
        systems.  Savors not only supports the output of existing
        commands, but does so in a manner consistent with those commands
        by combining the line-editing capabilities of vi, the rapid
        window manipulation of GNU screen, the power and compactness of
        perl expressions, and the elegance of Unix pipelines.  Savors
        was designed to support <em>impromptu visualization</em>,
        where the user can simply feed in the commands they were already
        using to create alternate views with optional on-the-fly
        aggregation of information across many systems.  In this way,
        visualization becomes part of the administrator's standard
        repertoire of monitoring and analysis techniques with no need
        for a priori aggregation of data at a centralized resource or
        conversion of the data into a predefined format.</p>

        <p>Savors is unique in its support of all four combinations of
        single/multiple data streams and single/multiple views.  That
        is, Savors can show any number of data streams either
        consolidated in the same view or spread out across multiple
        views.  In multi-data scenarios, data streams can be
        synchronized by time allowing even distributed data streams to
        be viewed in the same temporal context.  In single-data
        multi-view scenarios, views are updated in lockstep fashion so
        they show the same data at the same time.  Together with its
        integrated parallelization capabilities, this allows Savors to
        easily show meaningful results from across even very large
        installations.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Screenwm is a window management extension to GNU Screen that
        adds (1) multiple region layouts within a single session, (2)
        vi-like movement within complex layouts, (3) window associations
        by region, and (4) control of remote/embedded sessions using
        standard key bindings.  Although not required, Screenwm is
        intended to be used with the Screen vertical split patch
        available at <a href="http://fungi.yuggoth.org/vsp4s">
        http://fungi.yuggoth.org/vsp4s</a>, which is not yet a part of
        the standard Screen distribution.</p>

        <p>In Screen, a single terminal can be divided up into a set
        of regions constructed from arbitrary horizontal and vertical
        splits.  Each region displays one particular window at a time
        from the set of windows shared across all regions.  The window
        in each region can be changed as desired.  With the introduction
        of vertical splits, there are several problems with this
        model.</p>

        <p>First, the basic up/down region focus model becomes
        impractical as even though two regions might be right next to
        each other, the user may have to cycle through numerous other
        regions just to change between the two.</p>

        <p>Second, the basic Screen model of a pool of windows shared
        among all regions does not match typical usage patterns.  With
        the introduction of cheap widescreen displays, users typically
        have many different terminals side-by-side, each running a
        separate instance of Screen.  With vertical splits, multiple
        terminals can be multiplexed in a single full-width terminal,
        which provides many advantages such as movement/cut-paste
        between windows without the use of the mouse and multiple remote
        windows displayed simultaneously through a single SSH
        connection.  When this is done, however, the natural separation
        provided by individual Screen instances is lost and the user
        must now manage and cycle through the complete set of
        windows.</p>

        <p>Third, use of remote Screen sessions is a hassle as the
        Screen escape key must be depressed twice to send a command to
        the remote session.  Alternatively, the user can define a
        different key binding that sends two escape sequences, but then
        must remember to use the other binding when working with the
        other session while using the normal binding the rest of the
        time.</p>

        <p>Finally, Screen can only work with one region layout at a
        time and layouts must be manually managed by the user by
        combining then resplitting the main terminal.  Thus, for
        example, if the user wishes to switch between a set of remote
        side-by-side windows running in a remote Screen session to a set
        of local side-by-side windows running in the local session, they
        must manually split the terminal, then in each region, must
        manually select the window that they wish to work with.  Quick
        transitions between the two layouts is impossible as this
        tedious process must be done every time.</p>

        <p>Enter Screenwm.  Screenwm solves all of these problems
        using an external Perl executable and a set of Screen key
        bindings.  All basic Screen operations are intercepted by key
        bindings and fed to Screenwm, which keeps track of Screen's
        state in an external directory structure.  Screenwm then uses
        this information to derive an appropriate Screen command
        sequence, which is fed back to the Screen session.  Using this
        information, Screenwm can manage multiple region layouts
        simultaneously with instant and automatic transitions between
        them.  It allows vi-like movement between regions using a single
        keypress no matter how many regions it is actually cycling
        through.  It provides windows associated to regions instead of
        to a session, thus facilitating typical usage patterns.
        Finally, it allows a window to be tagged as a remote/embedded
        Screen session, which allows the same key bindings used for
        local Screen control to be passed on when appropriate to the
        remote session, thereby allowing the user to transparently work
        across multiple sessions.</p>

        <p>This project is similar to minimal X11 window managers such as
        Ratpoison.  The advantage, however, is that it does not require
        an X11 session.  Thus, complex terminal window layouts can be
        utilized remotely with just a single SSH connection, which is
        ideal for administration of remote servers or accessing hosts at
        work/home from home/work.</p>

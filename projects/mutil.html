    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Copies between local file systems are a daily activity.
        Files are constantly being moved to locations accessible by
        systems with different functions and/or storage limits, being
        backed up and restored, or being moved due to upgraded and/or
        replaced hardware.  Hence, maximizing the performance of copies
        as well as checksums that ensure the integrity of copies is
        desirable to minimize the turnaround time of user and
        administrator activities.  Modern parallel file systems
        provide very high performance for such operations using a
        variety of techniques such as striping files across multiple
        disks to increase aggregate I/O bandwidth and spreading disks
        across multiple servers to increase aggregate interconnect
        bandwidth.</p>

        <p>To achieve peak performance from such systems, it is
        typically necessary to utilize multiple concurrent
        readers/writers from multiple systems to overcome various
        single-system limitations such as number of processors and
        network bandwidth.  The standard cp and md5sum tools of GNU
        coreutils found on every modern Unix/Linux system, however,
        utilize a single execution thread on a single CPU core of a
        single system, hence cannot take full advantage of the increased
        performance of clustered file systems.</p>

        <p>Mutil provides mcp and msum, which are drop-in replacements
        for cp and md5sum that utilize multiple types of parallelism to
        achieve maximum copy and checksum performance on clustered file
        systems.  Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept
        as busy as possible.  Read/write parallelism allows individual
        operations of a single copy to be overlapped using asynchronous
        I/O.  Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part
        in the same copy/checksum.  Split file processing allows
        multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file.
        Finally, hash trees allow inherently serial checksums to be
        performed in parallel.</p>

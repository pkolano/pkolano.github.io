    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In high-end computing environments, remote file transfers of
        very large data sets to and from computational resources are
        commonplace as users are typically widely distributed across
        different organizations and must transfer in data to be
        processed and transfer out results for further analysis.  Local
        transfers of this same data across file systems are also
        frequently performed by administrators to optimize resource
        utilization when new file systems come on-line or storage
        becomes imbalanced between existing file systems.  In both
        cases, files must traverse many components on their journey from
        source to destination where there are numerous opportunities for
        performance optimization as well as failure.  A number of
        tools exist for providing reliable and/or high performance file
        transfer capabilities, but most either do not support local
        transfers, require specific security models and/or transport
        applications, are difficult for individual users to deploy,
        and/or are not fully optimized for highest performance.</p>

        <p>Shift is a framework for Self-Healing Independent File
        Transfer that provides high performance and resilience for
        local and remote transfers through a variety of techniques.
        These include end-to-end integrity via cryptographic hashes,
        throttling of transfers to prevent resource exhaustion,
        balancing transfers across resources based on load and
        availability, and parallelization of transfers across multiple
        source and destination hosts for increased redundancy and
        performance.  In addition, Shift was specifically designed to
        accommodate the diverse heterogeneous environments of a
        widespread user base with minimal assumptions about operating
        environments.  In particular, Shift is unique in its ability to
        provide advanced reliability and automatic single and multi-file
        parallelization to any stock command-line transfer application
        while being easily deployed by both individual users as well as
        entire organizations.</p>

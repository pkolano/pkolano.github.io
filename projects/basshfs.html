    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Working with remote systems over SSH is common in HPC
        environments where the size of data sets makes them nontrivial
        to relocate.  To run arbitrary commands on that data, a full SSH
        session is required.  There are cases, however, when the user
        may wish to perform simpler operations such as checking file
        existence and size, viewing differences between configuration
        files, creating directories, etc. that can be achieved with more
        limited access.  Juggling multiple sessions to multiple hosts
        may be inconvenient for such simple tasks.  BASSHFS is a tool
        that allows users to perform such tasks within a single terminal
        on a single host by transparently carrying out remote operations
        as needed to present remote files as if they are locally mounted
        when using the bash shell.</p>

        <p>BASSHFS is similar to the existing SSHFS utility except it
        is does not require FUSE kernel support.  Instead, BASSHFS uses
        the aliasing and function mechanisms of the bash shell to
        intercept program invocations and remap those that are supported
        to its own versions.  These internal versions determine if files
        on the command line are local or remote.  Remote files are
        processed transparently using a persistent SSH connection to the
        associated host(s).  Output associated with the local and remote
        files is then multiplexed together into the standard unified
        format associated with the original command.  To the user, it
        appears as if all files reside on a local file system even
        though they may span multiple files systems on multiple
        hosts.</p>

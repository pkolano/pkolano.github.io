    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>FreeMe is a tool for reducing e-mail clutter while
        highlighting messages of interest.  In particular, FreeMe was
        designed for large HPC environments, in which there are many
        thousands of interacting components that experience failures
        asynchronously.  During large-scale outages, administrators may
        receive overwhelming numbers of similar e-mails that may cause
        e-mails of unrelated failures to get lost in the shuffle and
        never resolved.</p>

        <p>FreeMe allows each administrator to manage their own
        individual subscriptions with the ability to match full regular
        expressions against any e-mail field, providing fine-grained
        filtering.  E-mails can either be processed as they are received
        in procmail-like fashion or read from an existing inbox.
        Options include ignoring uninteresting messages, having messages
        be resent on demand, or having them sent in a consolidated
        digest format, which dramatically reduces the number of messages
        received.  Original e-mails are kept in a historical archive
        that can be queried on demand.  FreeMe can also be used in a
        single-user configuration.</p>

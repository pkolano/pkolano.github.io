    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In typical security architectures, users access internal
        resources by first logging into an SSH bastion system that is
        locked down to a high degree to severely reduce the possibility
        of external compromise.  Such architectures can be configured to
        allow remote commands such as scp and rsync to operate between
        an external host and internal host through an intermediate hop
        to the bastion host.  Due to the stateful nature of SSH
        connections, when a bastion host becomes unavailable due to
        hardware/software failures or planned maintenance, all active
        remote commands will be terminated.  Since security updates must
        be applied to systems in a timely manner and many updates
        require system reboots, it is difficult to provide stable 24x7
        access to users without compromising either security or
        usability.</p>

        <p>SSHIM is a component that sits between the local program
        and the SSH channel and again between the SSH channel and the
        remote side of the program.  It is invoked using options that
        change the program used to spawn the SSH channel (e.g. rsync's
        -e option or scp's -S option).  When first invoked, SSHIM
        initiates the SSH channel and instead of calling the remote side
        of the local program, invokes itself on the remote system, which
        starts a limited daemon that itself invokes the remote side.
        Because the two sides of the local program are connected to
        SSHIM instances instead of SSH, they are unaware when the SSH
        channel is broken.  When SSHIM detects a channel failure, the
        local side respawns the connection and attempts to reconnect to
        its remote counterpart.  When successful, the remote command
        continues its operation as if the connection were stable.</p>

        <p>SSHIM is unique in its ability to provide resilient SSH
        connectivity without changes to the SSH protocol itself.  In
        particular, an organization using the previously described
        bastion architecture can deploy two (or more) redundant systems.
        When updates to the active bastion are necessary, the passive
        bastion can simply take over the active IP address using
        standard techniques such as gratuitous ARP.  If the SSHIM tool
        is being used for all connections, remote commands will
        transparently reroute through the new active bastion when the
        new passive bastion is updated without any failures noticeable
        to the user.</p>
